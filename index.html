        <p id="intro">Hello, my name is Mike and I've been a software developer for about two week's now.  When I'm not working on software development, I work at my regular job from 4:45 am to 4:00-5:30 pm Monday through Thursday and sometimes Friday...it keeps me busy...or exhausted.  Hopefully this time next year I will be spending all my working hours on software development and more time with my family.</p>

                <p>Every spring I get the itch to plant something.  The last three years, I started a straw bale garden and grew a bunch of vegetables.</p>
                <p>I also enjoy backpacking; although, I don't do it as much as I'd like to.  The last two times I went I learned how to fly fish.</p>
